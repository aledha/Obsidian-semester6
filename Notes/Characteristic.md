title: Definition.

_Let $R$ be a ring. If there exists some $n\in\N^+$ such that $\fa r\in R:nr=0$, then $R$ is said to have **nonzero characteristic**, in which case the **characteristic of $R$** is_
$$\begin{equation}
    \charac R\coloneqq\min\l\{n\in\N^+\mid\fa r\in R:nr=0\r\}.
\end{equation}$$
