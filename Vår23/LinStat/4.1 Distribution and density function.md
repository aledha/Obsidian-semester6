## Definition: Cumulative distribution function (CDF)
Let $X=\begin{bmatrix}X_{1} & X_{2} & \dots & X_{p}\end{bmatrix}^{T}$ be a random vector. The **CDF** is defined by
$$F(x)=P(X\le x)=P(X_{1}\le x_{1},\dots,X_{p}\le x_{p})$$
And for continuous $X$:
$$F(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{x}f(u) \text{d}u$$
Note that 
$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(u) \text{d}u=1$$
## Marginal CDF
Let $X$ be partitioned as $X=\begin{bmatrix}X_{1} | X_{2} \end{bmatrix}^{T}$. Let $X_{1}\in \mathbb{R}^{k}$ and $X_{2}\in \mathbb{R}^{p-k}$.
The marginal CDF is
$$F_{X_{1}}(x_{1})=P(X_{1}\le x_{1})=F(x_{11},\dots,x_{1k}, \infty,\dots, \infty)$$
If $X$ is continuous:
$$F_{X_{1}}(x_{1})=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x_{1},x_{2}) \text{d}x_{2}$$
(Integrating out the variable that is not of interest, $x_{2}$)

## Conditional CDF
The conditional pdf of $X_{2}$ given $X_{1}=x_{1}$ is given as
$$f(x_{2}| x_{1})= \frac{f(x_{1},x_{2})}{f_{X_{1}}(x_{1})}$$
The numerator is the [[4.1 Distribution and density function#Marginal CDF|Marginal CDF]].

## Sklar's theorem
Let F be a joint distribution function with marginal distribution functions $F_{X_1}$ and $F_{X_2}$ . Then a copula $C$ exists with
$$F(x_{1},x_{2})=C(F_{X_{1}}(x_{1}), F_{X_{2}}(x_{2}))\quad\forall\quad x_{1},x_{2}\in \mathbb{R}$$
* If $F_{X_{1}}, F_{X_{2}}$ are continuous, then $C$ is unique.
* With Sklar’s Theorem, the use of the name “copula” becomes obvious. It was chosen to describe “a function that links a multidimensional distribution to its one- dimensional margins”
## Theorem 4.2: Independance
Let $X_{1}, X_{2}$ be random variables. 
$X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ are independant $\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad$ The copula $C_{X_{1},X_{2}}=\Pi$ 
i.e.
$$F(x_{1}, x_{2})= \prod_{i=1}^{2}F_{X_{i}}(x_{i})$$
