title: Definition.

_Let $K$ be a field, fix $m,n\in\N^+$, and consider a matrix $A\in\mat{m\times n}{K}$._
* _If there exists a matrix $B\in\mat{n\times m}{K}$ such that $BA=I_n$, then $A$ is said to be **left-invertible** and $B$ is called a **left-inverse of $A$**._
* _If there exists a matrix $C\in\mat{n\times m}{K}$ such that $AC=I_m$, then $A$ is said to be **right-invertible** and $C$ is called a **right-inverse of $A$**._

_If $n=m$ and $A$ has both a left and a right inverse, then $A$ is said to be invertible and $A^{-1}\coloneqq C=D$ is called the **inverse of $A$**._
