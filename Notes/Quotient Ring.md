title: Definition.

_Let $I\subseteq R$ be an ideal of a ring $R$. Then the **quotient ring of $R$ under $I$** is the ring $\tpl{R/I,+,\cdot}$, where_
* _$\tpl{R/I,+}$ is the quotient group of $R$ under $I$ and_
* _$\cdot$ is the binary operation on $R/I$ defined by $\l(r_1+I\r)\cdot\l(r_2+I\r)\coloneqq r_1r_2+I$ for all $r_1,r_2\in R$._

```

**Remark.** If $I$ is only a left-ideal of $R$, then the quotient group $R/I$ no longer has a ring structure. However, it is still a left $R$-module via the action $R\times R/I\to R/I:\tpl{r,x+I}\mapsto rx+I$. This map is well-defined since for any $x+I=y+I\in R/I$ and any $r\in R$, we have that $rx-ry=r\l(x-y\r)\in I$, and hence $rx+I=ry+I$. The $R$-module axioms then follow from the ring axioms for $R$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
