_Let $\cat{J}$ and $\cat{C}$ be categories. A **diagram of type $\cat{J}$ in $\cat{C}$** is a functor $\ms{D}:\cat{J}\to\cat{C}$._

```

**Remark.** The category $\cat{J}$ is, in this context, referred to as the **index category**.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

---

**Remark.** This notion generalizes that of an indexed family but emphasizes the morphisms from $\ms{D}\l(j_1\r)$ to $\ms{D}\l(j_2\r)$ more than the objects themselves; hence the name $\textrm{`}$diagram$\textrm{'}$. The visualization of a diagram consists of $\textrm{`}$nodes$\textrm{'}$, which represent objects of the form $\ms{D}\l(j_n\r)$, and $\textrm{`}$arrows$\textrm{'}$, which represent morphisms $\ms{D}\l(j_k\r)\to\ms{D}\l(j_l\r)$ in $\cat{C}$; the identity and composite morphisms are omitted.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
