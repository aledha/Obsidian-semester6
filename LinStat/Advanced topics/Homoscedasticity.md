<u>Homoscedasticity</u>: *Equal variability of errors/residuals across the range of predictor values in regression analysis.*

In regression analysis, homoscedasticity refers to the assumption that the variability of errors or residuals is consistent or equal across the entire range of predictor or independent variables. In other words, it implies that the spread of the residuals is the same regardless of the values of the predictors.

<u>When homoscedasticity holds, the scatter of the residuals around the regression line should exhibit a roughly constant spread or dispersion.</u> This indicates that the errors have a consistent level of variability across different levels of the predictor variable(s).

Homoscedasticity is an important assumption in regression analysis because it ensures that the statistical tests and estimation procedures are valid and reliable. Violations of homoscedasticity, known as [[heteroscedasticity]], can lead to biased coefficient estimates, incorrect standard errors, and unreliable inferences.
