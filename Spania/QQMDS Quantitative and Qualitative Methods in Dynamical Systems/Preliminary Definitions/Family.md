>In manifold theory, $\mathcal{U}_\alpha$ usually represents an open set in the [[Topological manifold|manifold]], and $h_\alpha$ is a [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphism]] (or [[Diffeomorphism|diffeomorphism]] in the case of smooth manifolds) that maps $\mathcal{U}_\alpha$ to an open set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (or $\mathbb{C}^n$ for complex manifolds). The pair $(\mathcal{U}_\alpha, h_\alpha)$ is known as a "[[Charts|chart]]."
