_$\bigcup\em=\em$._

```

_Proof_. If $x\in\bigcup\em$, then, by definition of the union, there exists some $v\in\em$ such that $x\in v$. But such a set $v$ cannot exist, so $x\not\in\bigcup\em$ for all sets $x$. Thus $\bigcup\em$ is empty. Since the empty set is unique, we have $\bigcup\em=\em$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
