In the context of order relations, reflexivity, antisymmetry, transitivity, and comparability are properties that define the structure of the relation. These properties help us understand how elements within a set can be compared and organized.

1. Reflexivity:
A relation R on a set S is reflexive if for every element x in S, x is related to itself. In mathematical notation, this can be written as:

$$\forall x \in S: x R x$$

For example, the "less than or equal to" ($\leq$) relation on integers is reflexive because every integer is less than or equal to itself.

2. Antisymmetry:
A relation R on a set S is antisymmetric if for every pair of distinct elements x and y in S, when x is related to y, and y is related to x, it implies that x and y are the same element. In mathematical notation:

$$\forall x, y \in S: (x R y \land y R x) \implies x = y$$

For example, the "less than or equal to" ($\leq$) relation on integers is antisymmetric because if $x \leq y$ and $y \leq x$, then $x = y$.

3. Transitivity:
A relation R on a set S is transitive if for every three elements x, y, and z in S, when x is related to y and y is related to z, it implies that x is related to z. In mathematical notation:

$$\forall x, y, z \in S: (x R y \land y R z) \implies x R z$$

For example, the "less than or equal to" ($\leq$) relation on integers is transitive because if $x \leq y$ and $y \leq z$, then $x \leq z$.

4. Comparability:
A relation R on a set S is said to have the comparability property (or be a total order) if for every pair of elements x and y in S, either x is related to y or y is related to x. In mathematical notation:

$$\forall x, y \in S: (x R y) \lor (y R x)$$

For example, the "less than or equal to" ($\leq$) relation on integers has the comparability property because for any two integers, either one is less than or equal to the other, or vice versa.

These properties help define the structure of order relations and provide a way to understand how elements within a set can be compared and organized. Partial orders satisfy reflexivity, antisymmetry, and transitivity, while total orders satisfy all four properties, including comparability.
