title: Definition.

_Let $M$ and $N$ be $R$-modules. We say that **$M$ is isomorphic to $N$ as $R$-modules** if there exists an $R$-module isomorphism $\phi:M\to N$._

```

**Remark.** Since $\textrm{`}$is isomorphic to$\textrm{'}$ is an equivalence relation, we shall write $M\iso N$ and say that $M$ and $N$ are **isomorphic as $R$-modules**.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
