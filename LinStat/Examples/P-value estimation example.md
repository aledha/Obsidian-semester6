we want to find the p-value of the Area. 

Can't find precise value, but from Table 4 of $\textit{Tabeller og formler i statistikk}$ we see that the critical value (*crit. val.=* *the value of the t-statistic that separates the critical region from the non-critical region in a t-test*) in the t-distribution with $24$ degrees of freedom is $2.064$ for $\alpha = 0.025$. Since the critical value is known and corresponds to a significance level of 0.025 on each tail of the distribution, the p-value is estimated to be around $0.05$ (approximately).

Meaning: Test the null hypothesis that $\beta_{\text{Area}} = 0$ vs. $\beta_{\text{Area}} \neq 0$, with the other four covariates present in the model, and produce a p-value of the test.
