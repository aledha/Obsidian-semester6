title: Proposition (Burali-Forti Paradox).

_The collection of all ordinals $\ordinal$ is a proper class._

```

_Proof_. Suppose, for sake of contradiction, that $\ordinal$ is a set. It follows that $\ordinal$ is a transitive set and that $\in$ well-orders $\ordinal$, so, by definition, we see that $\ordinal$ is an ordinal number. But then $\ordinal\in\ordinal$, contradicting the fact that $\in$ is irreflexive on $\ordinal$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
