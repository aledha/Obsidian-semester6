title: Definition.

_Let $X$ be a set and $\leq$ be a partial order on $X$. The pair $\tpl{X,\leq}$ is called a **partially ordered set** or a **poset**._

```

**Remark.** Note that the pair $\tpl{X,<}$ is also called a poset; one can be constructed from the other.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
