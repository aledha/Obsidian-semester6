title: Definition.

_Let $G$ be a group and fix a subset $H\subseteq G$. Then $H$ is a **subgroup of $G$** if $H$ is a group under the induced operations._

```

**Remark.** It is clear that $H\subseteq G$ is a subgroup of $G$ iff $0\in H$ and that $H$ is closed under $\ast$ and inversion.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
