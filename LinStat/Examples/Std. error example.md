we want to find the Std. Error of the Nearest. 

The standard error of Nearest is calculated as the <u>estimate</u> divided by the <u>t-value</u>: $0.012 / 0.7 = 0.017$.

Meaning: The standard error represents the estimated standard deviation of the regression estimate. Mathematically, it corresponds to the diagonal element (Nearest) of the square root of $(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}s^2$ ([[Std. errors of regression coefficients]]), where $s^2$ is the estimate for the regression variance $\sigma^2$.
