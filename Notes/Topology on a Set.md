title: Definition.

_Let $X$ be a set. A **topology on $X$** is a set $\mc{T}\subseteq\pow\l(X\r)$ satisfying:_
* $\axitop[1]\bf{.}$ _$\em\in\mc{T}$ and $X\in\mc{T}$._
* $\axitop[2]\bf{.}$ _Arbitrary unions of elements of $\mc{T}$ are in $\mc{T}$:_
$$\begin{equation}
    \fa\mc{U}\subseteq\mc{T}:\bigcup\mc{U}\in\mc{T}.
\end{equation}$$
* $\axitop[3]\bf{.}$ _Finite intersections of elements of $\mc{T}$ are in $\mc{T}$:_
$$\begin{equation}
    \fa\mc{U}\subseteq\mc{T}:\l(\mc{U}\neq\em\land\mc{U}\textrm{\it{ is finite}}\r)\Rightarrow\bigcap\mc{U}\in\mc{T}.
\end{equation}$$
