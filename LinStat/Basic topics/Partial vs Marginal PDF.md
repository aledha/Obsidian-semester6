##### Partial PDF:
A partial PDF describes the probability density function of a subset of variables while keeping the remaining variables fixed. It allows for examining the conditional relationship between variables and how changes in the fixed variables impact the distribution of the variable of interest.

*Given a joint PDF $f(X, Y, Z)$, the partial PDF of $X$ while keeping $Y$ and $Z$ fixed at specific values $y$ and $z$ can be denoted as $f(X|Y=y, Z=z)$.*

##### Marginal PDF:
On the other hand, a marginal PDF represents the probability density function of a single variable in a multivariate distribution, while ignoring the values of the other variables. It provides insights into the distribution, characteristics, and properties of that specific variable independently.

*Consider a joint PDF $f(X, Y, Z)$. The marginal PDF of variable $X$ can be represented as $f(X)$, which captures the distribution of $X$ while ignoring the values of $Y$ and $Z$.*
