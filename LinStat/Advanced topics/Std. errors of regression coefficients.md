>The standard errors of the regression coefficients is denoted as
$$\sqrt{(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}s^2}$$

1. $(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}$ represents the inverse of the matrix product of the transpose of the design matrix $\mathbf{X}$ and the design matrix $\mathbf{X}$. The resulting matrix is used to calculate the standard errors of the regression coefficients.

2. $s^2$: This term is the estimate for the regression variance $\sigma^2$. It represents the estimated variability or spread of the residuals, which are the differences between the observed dependent variable values and the predicted values from the regression model.

Taking the square root of $(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}s^2$ yields the standard errors for each regression coefficient. The standard errors provide an estimate of the uncertainty or precision associated with each coefficient estimate.

By calculating the square root of $(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}s^2$ for each coefficient, we obtain the standard errors, which can be used to compute confidence intervals, perform hypothesis tests, and assess the statistical significance of the regression coefficients.
