title: Definition.

_Let $G$ and $H$ be groups. We say that **$G$ is isomorphic to $H$ as groups** if there exists a group isomorphism $\phi:G\to H$._

```

**Remark.** Since $\textrm{`}$is isomorphic to$\textrm{'}$ is an equivalence relation, we shall write $G\iso H$ and say that $G$ and $H$ are **isomorphic as groups**.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
