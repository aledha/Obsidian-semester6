title: Definition.

_Let $V$ be a $K$-vector space and consider a linear operator $T:V\to V$. A nonzero vector $v\in V$ is called an **eigenvector of $T$** if there exists some $\lambda\in K$ such that $T\l(v\r)=\lambda v$._

```

**Remark.** Since $T\l(v\r)=\lambda v$ is equivalent to $\l(T-\lambda\id_V\r)\l(v\r)=0$, we see that a nonzero vector $v\in V$ is an eigenvector of $T$ corresponding to $\lambda\in K$ iff $v\in\ker\l(T-\lambda\id_V\r)$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

**Remark.** Eigenvectors of a matrix $A\in\mat{n}{K}$ are defined as eigenvectors of $L_A$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
