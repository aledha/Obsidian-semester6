>[Shapiro-Wilk test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro%E2%80%93Wilk_test) is a statistical test for assessing the [[Normal Distribution|normality]] of a dataset. The test determines whether a given sample of data follows a [[Normal Distribution]] or not.

The Shapiro-Wilk test evaluates the null hypothesis that a dataset is normally distributed against the alternative hypothesis that it is not. The test is based on the correlation coefficient (W) calculated using the observed data and the expected values assuming a normal distribution.

The Shapiro-Wilk statistic (W) ranges between 0 and 1. A value close to 1 suggests that the data is approximately normally distributed, while a value closer to 0 indicates a departure from normality.
