title: Definition.

_ A commutative ring $R$ is said to be **Noetherian** if it satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions:_
* _Every ascending chain $I_1\subseteq I_2\subseteq\cdots$ of ideals in $R$ stabilizes; that is, there exists some $n\geq1$ such that $I_m=I_n$ for all $m\geq n$._
* _Every non-empty set $\mc{F}$ of ideals in $R$ has a $\subseteq$-maximal element._
* _Every ideal $I$ in $R$ is finitely-generated._
