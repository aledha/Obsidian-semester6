title: Definition.

_Let $R$ and $S$ be rings. We say that **$R$ is isomorphic to $S$ as rings** if there exists a ring isomorphism $\phi:R\to S$._

```

**Remark.** Since $\textrm{`}$is isomorphic to$\textrm{'}$ is an equivalence relation, we shall write $R\iso S$ and say that $R$ and $S$ are **isomorphic as rings**.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
