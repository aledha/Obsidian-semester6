title: Definition.

_Let $\tpl{X,\mc{T}}$ be a topological space and fix $S\subseteq X$. A point $p\in X$ is said to be a **cluster point of $S$** if $p\in\bar{S\comp\l\{p\r\}}$._

```

**Remark.** Cluster points of $S$ are also called **limit points** or **accumulation points** of $S$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
