title: Proposition.

_Let $R$ be an integral domain. Then its characteristic $\charac R$ is prime._

```

_Proof_. Let $n\coloneqq\charac R$. In particular, we have that $n1=0$. Suppose, for sake of contradiction, that $n$ is not prime, so there exist integers $1<a,b<n$ such that $n=ab$. But then
$$\begin{equation}
    a1\cdot b1=\l(ab\r)1=n1=0,
\end{equation}$$
so either $a1=0$ or $b1=0$. But $a,b<n$ and $n=\charac R$, so this forces $a=0$ or $b=0$, a contradiction.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
