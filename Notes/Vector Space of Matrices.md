``` ad-Definition
title: Definition.

_Let $K$ be a field and fix $m,n\in\N^+$. The **vector space of $\l(m\times n\r)$-matrices over $K$** is the set of all $\l(m\times n\r)$-matrices over $K$ equipped with the component-wise operations of addition and multiplication._

```

**Remark.** Formally, $\tpl{\mat{m\times n}{K},K,+,\cdot,0_{m\times n}}$ is the vector space of functions from $\l\{1,\dots,m\r\}\times\l\{1,\dots,n\r\}$ to $K$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
