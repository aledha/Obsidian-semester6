The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is one of the most commonly used probability distributions in statistics due to its nice mathematical properties and its prevalence in natural phenomena. 

The notation $N(0,1)$ refers to the standard normal distribution, which is a special case of the normal distribution where the mean $\mu = 0$ and the variance $\sigma^2 = 1$. The probability density function (pdf) of the standard normal distribution, denoted as $\phi(\cdot)$, is given by:
$$\phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}$$
for any real number $x$. Some important properties of the standard normal distribution include:
1. *It is symmetric about the mean. In this case, the mean is $0$, so the distribution is symmetric about $0$.*
2. *The total area under the curve of the pdf is $1$, which is a property of **all** pdfs.*
3. *The standard normal distribution is completely characterized by its mean and variance.* 

In the context of the moment generating function (MGF), the MGF of a standard normal random variable $X \sim N(0,1)$ is given by:

$$M_X(t) = E[e^{tX}] = e^{t^2/2}$$

for any real number $t$. The moments of the standard normal distribution can be derived from this MGF. For example, the first moment (the mean) is $0$, and the second central moment (the variance) is $1$.
