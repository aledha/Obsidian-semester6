title: Proposition.

_Let $X$ be a set and let $R$ be a well-order on $X$. If $S\subseteq X$, then $R$ well-orders $S$ too._

```

_Proof_. Any subset $T$ of $S$ is also a subset of $X$, and, since $R$ well-orders $X$, there exists a minimal element in $T$. Hence $R$ is a well-founded relation $S$. Since $R$ is connected and is a strict partial order on $X$, it is connected and is a strict partial order on $S$, and hence it is a strict total order on $S$ too.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
