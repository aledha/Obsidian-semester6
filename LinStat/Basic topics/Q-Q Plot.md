A Q-Q (quantile-quantile) normal plot based on studentized residuals is a graphical tool used in statistical analysis to assess the normality assumption of the residuals in a regression model. 

In a Q-Q normal plot based on studentized residuals, the x-axis represents the quantiles of a standard normal distribution (expected values), and the y-axis represents the quantiles of the studentized residuals (observed values). If the studentized residuals are normally distributed, the points on the plot will roughly form a straight line. Deviations from a straight line suggest departures from normality.

Interpreting the Q-Q normal plot involves examining the pattern of points on the plot. If the points form a reasonably straight line, it indicates that the residuals follow a normal distribution. If the points deviate significantly from a straight line, it suggests non-normality. Specifically, if the points deviate upwards or downwards in the tails, it suggests heavy-tailedness or skewness, respectively.
