title: Proposition.

_Let $K$ be a field and consider a matrix $A\in\mat{m\times n}{K}$ for some fixed $m,n\in\N^+$. Letting $R$ be a reduced row-echelon form of $A$, we can compute $\rank A$ by counting the number of non-zero rows or pivot columns of $R$._

```

_Proof_. Since $R$ is obtained via a finite number of elementary row operations on $A$, which preserve rank, we see that $\rank A=\rank R$.
* (Non-zero rows): Let $r\in\N$ be the number of non-zero rows of $R$. Since $R$ is in reduced row-echelon form, each non-zero row $\v{r}_i$ of $R$ contains a leading 1 in its pivot column $k_i$, so $\l(\v{r}_i\r)_{k_i}=1$ and $\l(\v{r}_l\r)_{k_i}=0$ for all $l\neq i$. Hence these rows are linearly independent, for suppose that there are coefficients $\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n\in K$ such that $\sum_{l=1}^r\alpha_l\v{r}_l=\v{0}$. Then, for all $i\in\l\{1,\dots,r\r\}$, its $k_i^\textrm{th}$ component is
$$\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \l(\sum_{l=1}^r\alpha_l\v{r}_l\r)_{\!k_i}&=\sum\limits_{l=1}^r\l(\alpha_l\v{r}_l\r)_{k_i} && \textrm{Definition of vector addition in }K^n \\
        &=\sum\limits_{l=1}^r\alpha_l\l(\v{r}_l\r)_{k_i} && \textrm{Definition of scalar multiplication in }K^n \\
        &=\sum\limits_{l=1}^r\alpha_l\delta_{il} && \l(\v{r}_l\r)_{k_i}=\delta_{il} \\
        &=\alpha_i, && \delta_{il}=0\textrm{ for all }l\neq i
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}$$
which vanishes by assumption. Since linearly independent sets must not contain zero vectors, we see that those rows form a maximally independent subset of all the rows of $R$, and hence a basis thereof. The result follows since $\rank R=\dim\row R=r$.

* (Pivot columns): Since every non-zero row corresponds uniquely to its pivot column, we see that the number of non-zero rows coincides with the number of pivot columns. The result follows.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
