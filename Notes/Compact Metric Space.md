``` ad-Definition
title: Definition.

_A metric space $\tpl{X,d}$ is said to be **compact** if every open cover has a finite subcover; that is, if $\mc{U}$ is a collection of open sets of $X$ such that $X\subseteq\bigcup\mc{U}$, then there exists some finite $\mc{U}'\subseteq\mc{U}$ such that $X\subseteq\mc{U}'$._

```

**Remark.** In other words, $\tpl{X,d}$ is compact if its induced topological space is.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
