Function composition is an operation $\circ$ that takes two functions $f$ and $g$, and produces a function $h = g \circ f$ such that $h(x) = g(f(x))$. 

In this operation, the function $g$ is applied to the result of applying the function $f$ to $x$. That is, the functions $f: X \to Y$ and $g: Y \to Z$ are composed to yield a function that maps $x$ in domain $X$ to $g(f(x))$ in codomain $Z$.
