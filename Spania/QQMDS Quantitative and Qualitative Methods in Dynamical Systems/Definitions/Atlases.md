>The description of most manifolds requires more than one [[Charts|chart]]. A specific collection of charts which covers a [[Topological manifold|manifold]] is called an atlas. 

An atlas is not unique as all manifolds can be covered in multiple ways using different combinations of charts. Two atlases are said to be equivalent if their union is also an atlas.
