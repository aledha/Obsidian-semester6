>The term $\hat{\sigma}^2$ represents the estimated variance of the error term in a linear regression model. It is commonly denoted as the "mean squared error" or "residual mean squared error."

The formula for estimating $\hat{\sigma}^2$ is:
$$\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{\text{SSE}}{n - p}$$
where:
-   $\text{SSE}$ is the [[SSE, SSR, and SST|sum of squared errors or the sum of squared residuals]] (the unexplained variation in the dependent variable),
-   $n$ is the number of observations in the dataset, and
-   $p$ is the number of predictors or independent variables in the model (excluding the intercept term).

In this formula, $\text{SSE}$ is divided by the degrees of freedom, which is $(n - p)$, to obtain an unbiased estimate of the error variance. The degrees of freedom represent the number of independent pieces of information available to estimate the error variance. It provides an indication of how well the model fits the data and how much unexplained variability remains in the dependent variable after considering the predictors.
