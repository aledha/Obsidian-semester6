>A (*coordinate map, a coordinate chart, or simply a*) **chart**, of a [[Topological manifold|manifold]] is an invertible map between a subset of the manifold and a simple space such that both the map and its inverse preserve the desired structure. 

For a [[Topological manifold|topological manifold]], the simple space is a subset of some Euclidean space $\mathbb {R} ^{n}$ and interest focuses on the topological structure. This structure is preserved by [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphisms]], invertible maps that are continuous in both directions.

In the case of a [[Differentiable manifold|differentiable manifold]], a set of charts called an [[Atlases|atlas]], whose transition functions are all differentiable, allows us to do calculus on it. Polar coordinates, for example, form a chart for the plane 
$\mathbb{R}^{2}$  minus the positive x-axis and the origin.
