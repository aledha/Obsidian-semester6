title: Proposition.

_Let $G$ be a group. If $G$ is cyclic, then $G$ is Abelian._

```

_Proof_. Since $G$ is cyclic, there exists some $x\in G$ such that $G=\cyclic{x}$. Take $g,h\in H$, so there exist $m,n\in\Z$ such that $g=x^n$ and $h=x^m$. Then
$$\begin{equation}
    hk=g^ng^m=g^{n+m}=g^{m+n}g^mg^n=hg.\qedin
\end{equation}$$
