_Let $M$ be a left $R$-module and fix a subset $N\subseteq M$. Then $N$ is a **left $R$-submodule of $M$** if $N$ is an $R$-module under the induced operations._

```

**Remark.** It is clear that $N\subseteq M$ is a left $R$-submodule of $M$ iff it is a subgroup that is closed under scalar multiplication.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
