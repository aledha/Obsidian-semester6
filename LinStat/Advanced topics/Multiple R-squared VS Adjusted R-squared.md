*The Multiple [[R-squared]] represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in the model.*
$$\text{V.S.}$$
*The [[R-squared adjusted|Adjusted R-squared]] adjusts the Multiple R-squared value based on the number of independent variables and the sample size. It penalizes the addition of unnecessary variables to the model, providing a more conservative estimate of the model's explanatory power.*

### Example

	Residual standard error: 60.98 on 24 degrees of freedom 
	Multiple R-squared: 0.7658, Adjusted R-squared: 0.7171 
	F-statistic: 15.7 on 5 and 24 DF, p-value: 6.838e-07

In this case, the Multiple R-squared is $0.7658$, indicating that approximately $76.58\%$ of the variability in the number of species can be explained by the independent variables. Adjusted R-squared is $0.7171$, which takes into account the number of independent variables and provides a slightly lower estimate of the model's explanatory power compared to the Multiple R-squared.
