The difference between the Anosov automorphism with the lift matrix $A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 3 \\ 1 & 2 \end{pmatrix}$ (as in your original problem) and the one with lift matrix $A' = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 \end{pmatrix}$ (the (3.3) lift) lies in the structure of their dynamics, particularly in how their stable and unstable manifolds behave on the torus.

1. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: The dynamics of an Anosov automorphism are significantly influenced by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of its lift matrix. The matrix $A$ and $A'$ will have different sets of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. These eigenvalues determine whether the dynamics are expanding or contracting in various directions, and the eigenvectors give the directions of these expansions and contractions.

2. **Stable and Unstable Manifolds**: For each lift, the stable and unstable manifolds on the torus can have different orientations and structures. Since the eigenvalues and eigenvectors differ between $A$ and $A'$, the slope of the separatrices (stable and unstable manifolds) in $\mathbb{R}^2$ will also differ. This leads to a different arrangement when these manifolds are projected onto the torus.

3. **Density and Winding on the Torus**: If the slopes of the separatrices for one matrix are rational and for the other are irrational, it would lead to a fundamental difference in how these lines wind around the torus. Rational slopes lead to closed loops on the torus, while irrational slopes lead to lines that densely fill a region of the torus, as mentioned earlier. 

4. **Dynamical Behavior**: These differences in the eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and the structure of the stable and unstable manifolds lead to variations in the dynamical behavior of the system. The presence of dense winding and transverse homoclinic points can indicate more chaotic dynamics for one system compared to the other.

In conclusion, the primary differences between the Anosov automorphisms with the two different lifts lie in the eigenstructure of the lift matrices and how this affects the behavior of the stable and unstable manifolds on the torus, subsequently influencing the overall dynamical behavior of the system.
