title: Proposition.

_Let $K$ be a field and consider an indexed subset_ $\mc{B}\coloneqq\l\{b_1,\dots,b_n\r\}$ _of a $K$-vector space $V$. Then $\mc{B}$ is an basis for $V$ iff it is a minimal spanning set of $V$._

```

_Proof_.
* ($\Rightarrow$): Suppose that $\mc{C}\coloneqq\l\{c_1,\dots,c_m\r\}$ spans $V$ for some $m\in\N^+$. Then, since $\mc{B}$ is linearly independent, we see that $n\leq m$. But $\mc{C}$ was arbitrary, so $\mc{B}$ is a minimal spanning set for $V$.

* ($\Leftarrow$): Let $\mc{B}$ be a minimal spanning set of $V$ and suppose, for sake of contradiction, that $\mc{B}$ is linearly independent. Then there exists some $2\leq l\leq n$ such that $b_l\in\span\l\{b_1,\dots,b_{l-1}\r\}$, a contradiction.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
