<u>Heteroscedasticity</u>: *Unequal variability of errors/residuals across the range of predictor values in regression analysis.*

When the plot of studentized residuals vs. fitted values exhibits a clear pattern, such as a fan shape or a widening/narrowing of the spread, it suggests heteroscedasticity in the errors. Heteroscedasticity means that the variability of the residuals is not constant across the range of the predicted values.

In the context of this regression model, if the plot of studentized residuals vs. fitted values shows a pattern, it indicates that the variability of the errors is not the same for all levels of the predicted values. This violates the assumption of [[homoscedasticity]], and it may impact the reliability and accuracy of the model's predictions.
