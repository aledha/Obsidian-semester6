An $n \times n$ square matrix $A$ is considered <u>idempotent</u> if when you multiply it by itself ($A^2$), you get the same matrix $A$. In other words, $A^2 = A$. 

The <u>trace</u>, denoted as $\text{tr}(A)$, is simply the sum of the diagonal entries of the matrix. In general, the trace of a matrix is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues (counted with multiplicities) or the roots of the characteristic polynomial.

The <u>rank</u>, denoted as $\text{rank}(A)$, refers to the dimension of the column space of the matrix. Another way to think of it is that the rank is equal to the dimension of the row space of the matrix.

For a square $n \times n$ matrix $A$ to be <u>invertible</u> (meaning it has an inverse), two conditions must be met. First, the rank of the matrix $A$ must be equal to $n$, the size of the matrix. Second, the matrix $A$ must not have 0 as an eigenvalue.
