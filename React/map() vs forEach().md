>`.map` and `.forEach` are both array methods in JavaScript, but they have some differences in their behavior and purpose.

1. Purpose:
   - `.map`: It is used to iterate over an array and create a new array based on the values of the original array. It transforms each element of the array and returns a new array of the same length.
   - `.forEach`: It is used to iterate over an array and perform a specified action on each element. It does not create a new array or return any values.

2. Return Value:
   - `.map`: It returns a new array containing the results of applying a provided function to each element of the original array.
   - `.forEach`: It does not return anything. It simply executes a callback function for each element in the array.

3. Usage:
   - `.map`: It is commonly used when you want to transform the elements of an array into a new set of values or objects.
   - `.forEach`: It is used when you want to perform a specific action or side effect on each element of an array, such as logging values or updating variables.

4. Modification of Original Array:
   - `.map`: It does not modify the original array. It creates and returns a new array based on the transformation performed on the original array.
   - `.forEach`: It does not create a new array but allows you to modify the elements of the original array.

Here's an example to illustrate the difference between `.map` and `.forEach`:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Example using .map
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map((num) => num * 2);
console.log(doubledNumbers); 
// Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

// Example using .forEach
numbers.forEach((num) => {
  console.log(num * 2);
});
// Output:
// 2
// 4
// 6
// 8
// 10
```

In the `.map` example, a new array `doubledNumbers` is created by doubling each element of the original `numbers` array. In the `.forEach` example, the elements of the `numbers` array are iterated, and each element is logged to the console after multiplying it by 2.
