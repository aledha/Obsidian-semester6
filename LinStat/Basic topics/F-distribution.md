>The F-distribution with $(p, q)$ degrees of freedom is a probability distribution that describes the ratio of two independent chi-squared random variables. We denote this distribution as $F_{p,q}$.

To construct an F-distributed random variable, we take a random variable $V$ that follows a chi-squared distribution with $p$ degrees of freedom, denoted as $V \sim \chi^2_p$. Similarly take anoter variable $W \sim \chi^2_q$.

The F-distributed random variable, denoted as $F$, is obtained by dividing $V$ by $p$ and dividing $W$ by $q$, resulting in the formula:
$$
F = \frac{V/p}{W/q},
$$
written as $F\sim F_{p,q}.$
