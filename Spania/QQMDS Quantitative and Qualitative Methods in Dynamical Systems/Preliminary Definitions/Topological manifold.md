>In topology, a topological manifold is a [[Topological space|topological space]] that locally resembles real n-dimensional Euclidean space. 

Topological manifolds are an important class of topological spaces, with applications throughout mathematics. <u>All manifolds are topological manifolds by definition</u>. 

Other types of manifolds are formed by adding structure to a topological manifold (e.g. [[Differentiable manifold|differentiable manifolds]] are topological manifolds equipped with a differential structure). Every manifold has an "underlying" topological manifold, obtained by simply "forgetting" the added structure. However, not every topological manifold can be endowed with a particular additional structure. 

For example, the E8 manifold is a topological manifold which cannot be endowed with a differentiable structure.
