>R^2represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (y) that can be explained by the independent variables (x) in a regression model. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that the model explains none of the variance and 1 indicates a perfect fit. The formula is

$$R^2 = 1 - \frac{SSR}{SST}$$
where [[SSE, SSR, and SST|SSR]] (Sum of Squares Residuals) is the sum of the squared differences between the observed values (y) and the predicted values (ŷ) from the regression model, and [[SSE, SSR, and SST|SST]] (Total Sum of Squares) is the sum of the squared differences between the observed values (y) and the mean of the dependent variable (ȳ).
