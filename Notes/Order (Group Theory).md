title: Definition.

_Let $\tpl{G,\ast,e}$ be a group and take $g\in G$. If there exists some $n\in\N^+$ such that $g^n=e$, then $g$ is said to have **finite order**, in which case the **order of $g$** is_
$$\begin{equation}
    \l|g\r|\coloneqq\min\l\{n\in\N^+\mid g^n=e\r\}.
\end{equation}$$

```

**Remark.** We define the **order of $G$** to be its cardinality $\l|G\r|$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
