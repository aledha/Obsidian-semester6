title: Theorem (Fundamental Theorem of Equivalence Relations).

_Let $X$ be a set._
1. _Let $\Pi$ be a partition on $X$. Then the binary relation_ $R_\Pi$ _induced by $\Pi$ is an equivalence relation on $X$._
2. _Let $R$ be an equivalence relation on $X$. Then the quotient set $X/R$ is a partition of $X$._

_Furthermore, we have_ $X/R_\Pi=\Pi$ _and_ $R_{X/R}=R$_._

**Remark.** The relationship between partitions, their induced relations, equivalences, and their quotient sets, can be visualized with the following schematic diagram.

The statements $X/R_\Pi=\Pi$ and $R_{X/R}=R$ are then viewed as $\textrm{`}$compatibility statements$\textrm{'}$, guaranteeing that the
* quotient set of the relation induced by $\Pi$ is $\Pi$ itself, and that the
* relation induced by the quotient set of a relation $R$ is $R$ itself.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

_Proof_. Statements $\#1$ and $\#2$ are proven; it suffices to show that $X/R_\Pi=\Pi$ and $R_{X/R}=R$.

Proof that $X/R_\Pi=\Pi$:
* ($\subseteq$): Take $x\in X$, so $\l[x\r]_{R_\Pi}\in X/R_\Pi$. Let $y\in\l[x\r]_{R_\Pi}$, so $yR_\Pi x$; that is, there exists $P\in\Pi$ such that $x,y\in P$; we shall prove that $\l[x\r]_{R_\Pi}=P\in\Pi$. To this end, take $z\in\l[x\r]_{R_\Pi}$. Observe that $zR_\Pi x$ and thus $zR_\Pi y$ too. It follows that there exists $P'\in\Pi$ such that $y\in P'\land z\in P'$, but, since $P\cap P'=\em$ if $P\neq P'$, this forces $P=P'$ and thus $z\in P$. Conversely, note that $P\in\Pi\subseteq\pow\l(X\r)$ and so $P\subseteq X$. Therefore, for all $p\in P$, we have $p\in X$ and thus, by definition of $R_\Pi$, we have $pR_\Pi x$. It follows that $p\in\l[x\r]_{R_\Pi}$.

* ($\supseteq$): Take $P\in\Pi$. Since $P\neq\em$, take $p\in P$. Recall that $P\subseteq X$, so $p\in X$ and thus $p\in\l[p\r]_{R_\Pi}$. It follows that $P\subseteq\l[p\r]_{R_\Pi}$. By the argument above, we have $\l[p\r]_{R_\Pi}\subseteq P$ and thus $P=\l[p\r]_{R_\Pi}\in X/R_\Pi$.

Proof that $R_{X/R}=R$:
* ($\subseteq$): Take $x,y\in X$ such that $\tpl{x,y}\in R_{X/R}$, which, by definition, implies that there exists $P\in X/R$ such that $x,y\in P$. However, the set $P$ is also an equivalence class of the form $\l[t\r]_R$ for some $t\in X$ such that $xRt$ and $yRt$. It follows that $xRy$ and hence $R_{X/R}\subseteq R$.

* ($\supseteq$): Take $x,y\in X$ such that $xRy$ from which it follows that $\l[x\r]_R=\l[y\r]_R$. Since $\l[x\r]_R,\l[y\r]_R\in X/R$ and $X/R$ is a partition on $X$, set $P\coloneqq\l[x\r]_R=\l[y\r]_R\in X/R$ and observe that $x,y\in P$. It follows, by definition of $R_{X/R}$, that $\tpl{x,y}\in R_{X/R}$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
