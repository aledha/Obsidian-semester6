title: Definition.

_A totally ordered field $\tpl{R,+,\cdot,0,1,<}$ is said to be an **ordered field of real numbers** if $\tpl{R,<}$ is Dedekind-complete._

```

**Remark.** Since any two models of the real numbers are isomorphic, we shall call any model thereof the **real numbers** and denote it by $\R$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
