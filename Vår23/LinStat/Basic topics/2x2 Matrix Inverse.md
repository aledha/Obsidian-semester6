The inverse (^-1) of a two- by two matrix is denoted as follows
$$A^{-1}=\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}^{-1} = \frac{1}{ad - bc} \begin{bmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{bmatrix}$$
Here, $ad - bc$ represents the determinant of matrix $A$. Warning: for the inverse to exist, the determinant of $A$ must be non-zero.
