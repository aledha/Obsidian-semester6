The difference between `let` and `const` is not specific to React, but it's a part of JavaScript (ES6). Both `let` and `const` are used to declare variables, but they have different behaviors with regard to mutability and re-assignment.

Here's a basic breakdown:

- `let`: This declaration allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement, or expression on which it is used. The variable can be updated and reassigned.

- `const`: This declaration creates a read-only reference to a value. The value cannot be reassigned, and the variable cannot be redeclared. This does not mean the value it holds is immutable, it just means that the variable identifier cannot be reassigned. For instance, if the content is an object, this means the object's contents (e.g., its parameters) can be altered.

For example:

```javascript
let a = 1; // declaring a variable with let
a = 2; // this is valid, because 'let' allows reassignment

const b = 1; // declaring a variable with const
b = 2; // this will throw an error, because 'const' does not allow reassignment

const c = {foo: 'bar'}; // declaring an object with const
c.foo = 'baz'; // this is valid, because 'const' allows mutation of the object
c = {foo: 'qux'}; // this will throw an error, because 'const' does not allow reassignment
```

In the context of React, you would often use `const` to define your functional components or other values that you don't intend to reassign. `let` might be used inside a function for a value that could change each time the function is called or during the function's execution.
