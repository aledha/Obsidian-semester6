title: Proposition.

_Let $K$ be a field and consider an indexed subset_ $\mc{B}\coloneqq\l\{b_1,\dots,b_n\r\}$ _of a $K$-vector space $V$. Then $\mc{B}$ is an basis for $V$ iff it is a maximal linearly independent set in $V$._

```

_Proof_.
* ($\Rightarrow$): Suppose that $\mc{C}\coloneqq\l\{c_1,\dots,c_m\r\}$ is a linearly independent set in $V$. Then, since $\mc{B}$ spans $V$, we see that $m\leq n$. But $\mc{C}$ was arbitrary, so $\mc{B}$ is a maximal linearly independent set in $V$.

* $\l(\Leftarrow\r)$: Let $\mc{B}$ be a maximal linearly independent set in $V$ and suppose, for sake of contradiction, that $\mc{B}$ does not span $V$. Thus there exists some $b_{n+1}\in V$ such that $b_{n+1}\not\in\span\mc{B}$, so $\mc{B}\cup b_{n+1}$ is linearly independent, a contradiction.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
