title: Definition.

_Fix $x\in\R$. A sequence_ $\tpl{x_n}_{n\in\N}$ _in $\R$ is said to **converge to $x$**, and $x$ is said to be the **limit of $\tpl{x_n}$**, if_
$$\begin{equation}
    \fa\epsilon>0,\fa^\infty n\in\N:\l|x_n-x\r|<\epsilon,
\end{equation}$$
_in which case we write_ $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}x_n=x$ _or $x_n\to x$ as $n\to\infty$._
