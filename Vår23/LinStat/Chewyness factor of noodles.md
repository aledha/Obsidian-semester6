## Introduction
In this project, we are interested in studying how different factors affect the chewyness factor of homemade noodles. We will setup four bowls, each with 150 grams of all-purpose flower. Then we add water, 70 mL in bowls one and two, 100 mL in bowls three and four. Then we add baked baking soda, 0.5 tsp bowls one and three, 1.5 tsp in bowls two and four. Then we take knead the four doughs and take a two 15 gram samples from each bowl. Then we boil the two samples for 2 and 4 minutes, respectively. 

The measure of chewyness will be done experimentally by putting a noodle on a digital kitchen weight and slowly applying pressure with a dull knife while filming the weight to pinpoint how much force was needed to cut.

(visual differences in two and four minutes - more doughy)
(pasta water)
(small sample size to keep water temp constant)





## Selection of factors
We have chosen to perform a 3-factor 2-level experiment. For example, the weight might be inaccurate or not updating fast enough. The three factors we will look at are how much water to add to the dough, how much baking soda to add, and how long we cook the noodles. 

The different levels are as follows
* 100 mL water                  70 mL water
* 0.5 tsp baking soda        1.5 tsp baking soda
* 2 minute cooktime          4 minute cooktime

In advance, we expect the cooktime and the water added to be the most influential.

We will perform the experiment twice and in random order.


### Bowl  1
70 mL water, 0.5 tsp baked baking soda
* 2 minutes: 2266 g
* 4 minutes: 3043 g

### Bowl 2
70 mL water, 1.5 tsp baked baking soda
* 2 minutes: 3574
* 4 minutes: 3369

### Bowl 3
100 mL water, 0.5 tsp
* 2 min: 2449
* 4 min: 2640

### Bowl 4
100 mL, 1.5 tsp
* 2 min: 2795
* 4 min: 2474
