To check convergence of the method, we will take 
$$u(x,y)=\text{sin}(\pi x) \text{cos}(\pi y)$$
And compute $f$ by inserting $u$ into the equation
$$(a+1)u_{xx}+2ru_{xy}+r^{2}u_{yy}=-f$$
$$\begin{align*}
-f&= (a+1)\partial_{x}[\pi \text{ cos}(\pi x) \text{ cos}(\pi y)]+2r\partial_{x}[-\pi\text{ sin}(\pi x)\text{ sin}(\pi y)]+r^{2}\partial_{y}[-\pi \text{ sin}(\pi x)\text{ sin}(\pi y)]\\
&= (a+1)(-\pi^{2}) \text{ sin}(\pi x)\text{ cos}(\pi y) +2r (-\pi ^{2})\text{ cos}(\pi x)\text{ sin}(\pi y) + r^{2}(-\pi^{2})\text{ sin}(\pi x) \text{ cos}(\pi y)\\
f&= \pi^{2} \Big[(a+1+r^{2})\text{ sin}(\pi x)\text{ cos}(\pi y)+2r \text{ cos}(\pi x)\text{ sin}(\pi y)  \Big]
\end{align*}$$
The boundary conditions can easily be retrieved from the exact solution.

By solving with the method for different values of the step length $h$, we can check convergence.
(insert log-log plot)
Which nicely coincides with the theory we computed previously
