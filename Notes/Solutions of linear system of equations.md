title: Theorem.

_Let $K$ be a field and consider an $m\times n$ linear system $A\v{x}=\v{b}$ for some fixed $m,n\in\N^+$. Then the following methods may be used to find solution(s) of $A\v{x}=\v{b}$._
* _If $A$ is invertible, then there exists a unique solution $\v{s}\coloneqq A^{-1}\v{b}$._
    * _This is only useful if $A^{-1}$ is given as reducing $\l[A\mid I\r]$ to $\l[I\mid A^{-1}\r]$ involves elementary row operations (so we may was well use Gaussian Elimination in the first place)._
* _If $\v{s}_p\in K^n$ is a particular solution of $A\v{x}=\v{b}$, then the solution set of $A\v{x}=\v{b}$ is $\l\{\v{s}_p\r\}+\nullsp A$._
    * _This is only useful if we can spot $\v{s}_p$ and if $\nullsp A$ can be computed easily._
* _Otherwise, use Gaussian Elimination to find solutions of $A\v{x}=\v{b}$, if any._
    * _This is the most robust method (and we obtain $\v{s}_p$, $\nullsp A$, and $\rank A$ for free)._
