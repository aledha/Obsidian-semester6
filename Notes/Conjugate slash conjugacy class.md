title: Definition.

_Let $G$ be a group and fix $x,y\in G$. Then **$x$ is conjugate to $y$** if there exists some $g\in G$ such that $x=g^{-1}yg$, in which case we call the equivalence class $\l[x\r]$ the **conjugacy class of $x$ in $G$**._

```

**Remark.** If $G$ is Abelian, then $x=g^{-1}yg$ for some $g\in G$ iff $x=yg^{-1}g=y$, so $\l[x\r]=\l\{x\r\}$ is just a singleton. Those are not interesting, so we only consider conjugacy for non-Abelian groups.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
