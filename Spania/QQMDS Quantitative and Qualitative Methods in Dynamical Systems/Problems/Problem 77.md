Alright, for part (b) of the problem, we need to show that the change of variables $y = x - \frac{\mu_1}{2}$ leads to a specific form of the vector field and then compare this field with $y˙ = \mu_0 + \frac{\mu_1^2}{4} - y^2$. Let's start by transforming the original equation step by step.

Original equation:
$$ x˙ = \mu_0 + \mu_1x - x^2 - \mu_r x^r $$
where \( r \geq 3 \).

Change of variables:
$$ y = x - \frac{\mu_1}{2} $$
$$ x = y + \frac{\mu_1}{2} $$

We will substitute this expression for $x$ into the original equation and simplify it step by step. This process will involve expanding terms and grouping them according to the powers of $y$. I'll start by substituting and then proceed to simplify the equation. Let's begin:

The transformed equation, after substituting $x = y + \frac{\mu_1}{2}$, simplifies to:
$$\mu_0 + \frac{\mu_1^2}{2} + \mu_1 y - \frac{(\mu_1 + 2y)^2}{4} - 2^{-r} \mu_r (\mu_1 + 2y)^r $$

Next, we need to expand this equation further and group the terms according to the powers of $y$. This will allow us to compare it with the given vector field $y˙ = \mu_0 + \frac{\mu_1^2}{4} - y^2$. I'll proceed with the expansion and grouping.

The expanded and grouped equation is:
$$ \mu_0 + \frac{\mu_1^2}{4} - y^2 - 2^{-r} \mu_r (\mu_1 + 2y)^r $$

This expression already resembles the form $y˙ = \mu_0 + \frac{\mu_1^2}{4} - y^2$, but it includes an additional term, $- 2^{-r} \mu_r (\mu_1 + 2y)^r$, which is significant for the comparison. 

Now, let's analyze this additional term and compare the transformed vector field with $y˙ = \mu_0 + \frac{\mu_1^2}{4} - y^2$. I'll expand the term $- 2^{-r} \mu_r (\mu_1 + 2y)^r$ to see its contribution to the overall equation.

The expanded form of the additional term $- 2^{-r} \mu_r (\mu_1 + 2y)^r$ remains as is, without simplifying to a polynomial in $y$. This indicates the presence of higher-order terms in $y$ (of order $r$ and possibly mixed terms involving both $\mu_1$ and $y$).

Comparing this with the vector field $y˙ = \mu_0 + \frac{\mu_1^2}{4} - y^2$, we observe the following:

1. **Similar Terms**: Both vector fields have the terms $\mu_0 + \frac{\mu_1^2}{4} - y^2$, which implies a similar basic structure.

2. **Additional Complexity**: The term $- 2^{-r} \mu_r (\mu_1 + 2y)^r$ introduces additional complexity into the vector field. This term represents higher-order dependencies on $y$ (and potentially $\mu_1$), which are not present in the simpler $y˙ = \mu_0 + \frac{\mu_1^2}{4} - y^2$.

3. **Impact of r and mu_r**: The parameter $r$ (which is $\geq 3$) and $\mu_r$ play significant roles in the complexity of the transformed vector field. Their values will influence the behavior of the system, especially for larger values of $y$.

In summary, while the basic structure of the transformed vector field shares similarities with $y˙ = \mu_0 + \frac{\mu_1^2}{4} - y^2$, the additional term introduces significant complexity and higher-order dependencies that distinguish it from the simpler form. This indicates a more complex dynamical behavior in the transformed system.
