To explore our method further, we consider a situation where $r$ is irrational. This poses a problem since we now cannot choose an $h$ such that we hit the upper boundary, $y=2$. 

There are multiple ways of solving this issue, but we went for what seemed simplest, namely fattening the boundary. This is method to impose boundary conditions on an irregular grid. We extend the domain such that there is one row that is outside, and then we set the new boundary on this row. See sketch. 

Theoretically, this should give us convergence of order order 1 near the boundary. Let's check if this holds with $r=\pi$. We will reuse the example of $u(x,y)=\text{ sin}(\pi x)\text{ cos}(\pi y)$. Then we compare the second to last row of the numerical result with the exact solution.

Which coincides nicely with our expectations.
