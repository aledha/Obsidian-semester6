We wish to model the stationary temperature distribution in an antistropic material. This can be described with the following equation
$$
-\nabla \cdot(\kappa \nabla T)=f \quad \text{in }\Omega
$$
With heat conductivity $\kappa$
We are interested in the domain $\Omega=[0,1]\times[0,2]$, and want to discretise in directions $\vec{d_{1}}=\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix},\vec{d_{2}}=\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ r\end{bmatrix}$, such that we can describe heat flow in these two directions.

We arrive at the equation with second order directional derivatives in the $\vec{d_{1}},\vec{d_{2}}$ directions:
$$a \partial_{x}^{2}u+(\vec{d_{2}}\cdot\nabla ^{2})u=-f$$
Here, $\frac{a}{1+r^{2}}$ represents the relative strength of conductivity in the $\vec{d_{1}},\vec{d_{2}}$ directions. Let's discretize this using second order central differences these directions.
Firstly, we study the stencil and grid:

(insert)
And arrive at
$$\begin{align*}
a \frac{1}{h^{2}}\delta_{x}^{2}U_{P}+ \frac{1}{h^{2}}\delta_{d_{2}}^{2}U_{P}&= -f_{P}\quad\text{for }P\in \mathbb{G}\\
a (U_{E}-2U_{P}+U_{W})+ (U_{N}-2U_{P}+U_{S})&= -h^{2}f_{P}\\
-\mathcal{L}U_{P}:=-aU_{E}-aU_{W}+2(a+1)U_{P}- U_{N}-U_{S}&= h^{2}f_{P}
\end{align*}
$$
We want to write this in the form of a linear equation, 
$$A \vec{U}+\vec{g}=h^{2}\vec{f}$$
(where $\vec{g}$ is the contribution from boundary conditions). We need to numerate the nodes, so we use natural ordering as described in the sketch above.

We see from the sketches that $A$ should consist of block matrices
$$A=\begin{bmatrix}C & B &  &  \\ D & C & \ddots &  \\  & \ddots & \ddots & B \\  &  & D & C\end{bmatrix}$$
Where $C,B,D\in \mathbb{R}^{(M-1)\times(M-1)}$. 
And $C=\text{tridiag}(-a,2(a+1), -a), \quad B=\text{tridiag}(0,0, -1), \quad D=\text{tridiag}(-1,0,0)$

Let's take a look at boundary conditions $u=g \quad \text{in } \partial_{}\Omega$
Assuming that we get $\vec{r},\vec{l},\vec{b},\vec{t}\in \mathbb{R}^{M+1}$ as inputs, our strategy is to construct a matrix $G\in \mathbb{R}^{(M-1)\times(M-1)}$ consisting of contributions from the boundary at each point. After this, we flatten to an $\vec{g}\in \mathbb{R}^{(M-1)^{2}}$.
From our sketch, we can see that
* For the leftmost points, point number $i$ gets the contribution $-al_{i} -l_{i-1}$
* For the rightmost points, point number $i$ gets the contribution $-ar_{i}-r_{i+1}$
* For the bottom points, point number $i$ gets the contribution $-b_{i-1}$
* For the top points, point number $i$ gets the contribution $-t_{i+1}$ 
Where we will not include $b_{0}$ or $t_{M+1}$, as the contribution from these points are already counted ($b_{0}=l_{0},\quad t_{M+1}=r_{M+1}$)
