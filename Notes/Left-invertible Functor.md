title: Definition.

_Let $\cat{C}$ and $\cat{D}$ be categories. A functor $\ms{F}:\cat{C}\to\cat{D}$ is said to be **(weakly) left-invertible** if there exists a functor $\ms{G}:\cat{D}\to\cat{C}$ such that $\ms{G}\circ\ms{F}$ is naturally isomorphic to_ $\Id_\cat{C}$_, in which case $\ms{G}$ is called a **(weak) left-inverse of $\ms{F}$**._

```

**Remark.** If equality holds; that is, if $\ms{G}\circ\ms{F}=\Id_\cat{C}$, then $\ms{F}$ is **strictly invertible** and $\ms{G}$ is called a **strict left-inverse of $\ms{F}$**.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
